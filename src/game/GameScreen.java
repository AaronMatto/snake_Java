// Snake Navigation System Design
// How should the game be set up such that the snake moves?
// A grid seems a good place to start. I need a means of identifying each cell as to allow the snake
// to move and also to place the food.
// What data structure should this identification system use? An array of each instance of JPanel may work
// as the index of each panel can identify it/it's cell.
// Or an array of arrays where each nested array contains row number and column number
// Or a hash/map?
// I need to consider how this will impact the difficulty of moving the snake and placing
// the food randomly in order to decide what's best, as well as perhaps efficiency (although
// that is not a priority here).
// I think a double array is the best way to go as the grid does not need to dynamically
// change size (it is fixed) and every cell is populated with a color to identify
// it as empty space, food, or the snake.
